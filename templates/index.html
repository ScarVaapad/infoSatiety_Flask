                        <p>The purpose of this research study is to see <b><i>individual factors on perception about enough information in decision-making</i></b>. You are eligible to participate in this research study if you are at least 18 years old and have not already completed this study.</p>
                        <p>Participation in this research study is completely voluntary. Alternatively, you may agree to participate in this study now but change your mind part way through. Note that if you end the study before completing it, your data will not be recorded and you will not be eligible to make a submission.</p>
                        <p>If you agree to take part in this research, you are expected to take the following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First you will be asked to perform a timed visualization test, note that <b>the test result will not affect your task performance.</b></li>
                            <li>Then, you are asked to read a series of scatterplots, which <b>will initially be blank</b>. You will need to use a button to <b>request more data</b> into the scatterplot, and you need to decide how much data is enough for you to <b>draw trend line</b> to represent a linear relationship of the two variables. <b>Part of your compensation is based on your accuracy and efficient use of data (details explained through following tutorials)</b>.</li>
                            <li>After the tasks, you are invited to take <b>two surveys</b> which give us your basic <b>demographic information</b>, a brief description of <b>your personality</b> and then an open-ended questionnaire to share your thoughts. Note that <b>none of the surveys or questionnaire are designed to penalize your performance</b>.</li>
                            <li><b>Data Collection</b>: while performing the tasks, your <b>mouse movement data</b>, <b>click streams</b> and <b>time stamps</b> for certain actions (like button clicking and line drawing) will be recorded. The data is collected for behavior pattern analysis only and <b>will not impact any evaluation of your performance</b>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your participation in this study will take <b>less than 20 minutes</b> and your compensation will be ranged from $2.5 to $7.3 based on your task performance (will be explained in tutorials). There are no other direct benefits to subjects as a result of participating in this study, and a possible risk of taking the study is the consequences of breach of confidentiality.</p>
                        <p><b>Privacy and Confidentiality</b>: Your worker ID <b>will not be shared</b> with anyone outside of the research team, will be removed from the dataset. Note that your worker ID might be linked to your public profile from your platform, and thus could be disclosed; in the event that subject contacts the study team through the platform, your information may be provided to the researchers. Additionally, this research is funded in part by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Certain DoD representatives are authorized to review anonymized research records as part of their responsibility to ensure adequate protections for research participants. However, the research team will not make any attempts to deidentify any participants through their public profiles, tax reporting, or any other means. Your worker ID will <b>only be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be associated with survey responses or data collected</b>. We will delete all worker IDs from our data after compensation has been issued. </p>
                        <p> Responses will be screened for honest participation prior to compensation.</p>
                        <p>
