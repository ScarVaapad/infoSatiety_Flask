                        <p>The purpose of this research study is to see <b><i>individual factors on perception about enough information in decision-making</i></b>. You are eligible to participate in this research study if you are over 18 years old and have not already completed this study.te in this research study if you are over 18 years old and have not already completed this study.</p>
                        <p>Being in a research study is completely voluntary. You can choose not to be in this research study. You can also say yes now and change your mind later. Note that if you end the study before completing it, your data will not be recorded and you will not be eligible to make a submission.</p>
                        <p>If you agree to take part in this research, you are expected to take the following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take <b>two surveys</b> which give us your basic <b>demographic information</b>, a brief description of <b>your personality</b> and <b>your ability to comprehend visualizations</b>, note that <b>none of the tests are designed to penalize your further effort</b>.</li>
                            <li>Then, you are asked to read a series of scatterplots, which <b>initially show nothing</b>. You will need to use a button to <b>request more data</b> into the scatterplot, and you need to decide how much data is enough for you to <b>draw a trendline</b> to represent a linear relationship of the two variables. <b>Part of your compensation is based on your accuracy and efficient use of data (detailed explained later with tutorials)</b>.</li>
                            <li><b>Data Collection</b>: while performing the tasks, your <b>mouse movement data</b>, <b>click streams</b> and <b>time stamps</b> for certain actions (like button clicking and line drawing) will be recorded. The data is collected for behavior pattern analysis only and <b>will not impact any evaluation of your performances</b>.</li>
                            <li>After the tasks, you are invited to a post-task questionnaire where you will be asked open-ended questions as well as address your concerns.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your participation in this study will take <b>less than 20 minutes</b> and your compensation will be ranged from $2.5 to $7.3 based on your task performance (will be explained in tutorials). There are no other direct benefits to subjects as a result of participating in this study, and a possible risk of taking the study is the consequences of breach of confidentiality.</p>
                        <p><b>Privacy and Confidentiality</b>: Your worker ID <b>will not be shared</b> with anyone outside of the research team, will be removed from the dataset. Note that your worker ID might be linked to your public profile from your platform, and thus could be disclosed; in the event that subject contacts the study team through the platform, your information may be provided to the researchers. Additionally, this research is funded in part by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Certain DoD representatives are authorized to review anonymized research records as part of their responsibility to ensure adequate protections for research participants. However, the research team will not make any attempts to deidentify any participants through their public profiles, tax reporting, or any other means. Your worker ID will <b>only be collected for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be associated with survey responses or data collected</b>. We will delete all worker IDs from our data after compensation has been issued. </p>
                        <p> Responses will be screened for honest participation prior to compensation.</p>
                        <p>
